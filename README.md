##My Responsive Profile Page

This is a responsive profile designed to look good on many different platforms using bootstrap css.In these pages you will get to know a little bit about me. It consists of three pages, an about me page with a few things about me, like an overview of my work history and a few of my interests, as well as a profile picture. A portfolio page where I will display some of the projects I've worked on, currently it's just some images that I enjoy as placeholders until I have some work to show. A contact page where people will be able to input their name, e-mail address and a brief message. The layout of these pages changes based upon the viewing area of the device being used to view them.
